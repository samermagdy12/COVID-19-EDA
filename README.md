# COVID-19 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 🎯 Project Goal
This project provides a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the World Health Organization (WHO) COVID-19 global daily data. The goal is to uncover trends, patterns, and insights into the spread and impact of the pandemic across different regions and time periods using data visualization and statistical methods.

## ✨ Key Insights & Visualizations
The analysis focuses on:
*   Global and regional case and death trends over time.
*   Comparison of growth rates between countries.
*   Identification of key milestones and turning points in the pandemic.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
| Component | Technology | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Analysis** | Jupyter Notebook | Interactive environment for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization. |
| **Language** | Python | Core programming language. |
| **Libraries** | Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, etc. | Data manipulation and visualization. |

## 🚀 Setup and Run Instructions
